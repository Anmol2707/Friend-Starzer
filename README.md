# Friend-Starzer

Want to star all the repo's of your friend?
Here is the solution.

This is a simple python script in which you enter your friend's username and it automatically stars all the repositories made by your friend up till now. It intelligently not stars the forks your friend did.


Added a reverse mechanism for un-starring all the repos.


####Installation:
	git clone https://github.com/adityajain21/Friend-Starzer.git && cd Friend-Starzer/
	pip install -r requirments.txt
	python main.py


- Requires 'Mechanize'.
- Should work on Python 2 and Python 3.
